                <p>This is the ultimate sweet & savory meal. It may sound like an odd combination, but the sweet waffles taste amazing. Especially when they are drenched in the spicy maple syrup and eaten with the crispy fried chicken. This sweet and savory combination is a specialty at the Los Angeles institution Roscoe’s House of Chicken and Waffles. While there are several different locations around LA it has become a tradition of Aaron and mine to make a stop after USC football games at the Coliseum.</p>

            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <h4>Fried Chicken</h4>

                        <li>In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, paprika, garlic, onion powder and cayenne. Season the chicken breasts with the mixture and place in a medium bowl. Let the chicken marinate in the spices for at least an hour.</li>

                        <li>Whisk the buttermilk and egg together in a medium bowl. In a shallow bowl stir flour and cornstarch together. Once piece at a time, dip chicken in the buttermilk then dredge in the flour mixture.</li>
                        <li>Fry in the oil until the chicken is golden brown on all sides. Remove the chicken from the oil and place on paper towels or a wire rack to drain the excess oil.</li>
